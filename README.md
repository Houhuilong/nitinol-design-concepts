Nitinol Design Concepts
=======================

Nitinol Devices and Components was founded in 1991, and has always been a leader in design, development, and commercialization of nitinol materials, components, and medical devices. Now as part of [Confluent Medical Technologies](https://confluentmedical.com), we have expanded to include medical balloons, catheters, precision polymers, textiles, and world class manufacturing capabilities. Science, publication, outreach, and education have always been a priority for us, and you can find many of our papers at the [nitinol.com](https://nitinol.com) reference library. Nitinol Design Concepts is an open-source, creative-commons spin on that tradition. Each topic in this series includes a tech-brief style article, as indexed below. All of the related design files, results, code, and data can be found in the [nitinol-design-concepts](https://github.com/cbonsig/nitinol-design-concepts) GitHub repository.

The content here includes a deeper dive into topic covered in our Nitinol University courses, as well as research supporting scientific presentation and publications. [Design Tutorial](#design-tutorial) provides an introduction to design and simulation of a nitinol component, following methods that are commonly applied in the medical device industry. [Advanced Topics](#advanced-topics) ventures into some more speculative territory, including new and emerging approaches that we find interesting. 


## Design Tutorial

This first series follows each step in the design and analysis of a realistic (but non-proprietary) laser cut nitinol component, from designing the geometry using Solidworks to shape setting and fatigue cycling using Abaqus.

* [Design](105-open-frame-design) \| Create a 3D model of a laser cut Open Frame component using Solidworks.
* [Mechanical Properties](110-material-characterization) \| Perform tensile testing to characterize mechanical properties for simulation.
* [Shape Setting](115-open-frame-shape-set) \| Expand the laser cut component into a complex expanded shape using Abaqus finite element analysis.
* [Fatigue Simulation](120-open-frame-fatigue) \| Apply fatigue loading conditions using Abaqus.

## Advanced Topics

* [Volumetric FEA Postprocessing](125-volumetric-analysis) \| Advanced scripting to extract volumetric stress and strain data from an Abaqus output database.
* [Advancing Nitinol Fatigue Prediction](205-advancing-fatigue-prediction) \| A review of present and future approaches to lifetime prediction of superelastic nitinol.
* [Volumetric characterization of inclusions from submicron CT scans](210-xct-methods) \| submicron xray tomography: methods and results
* probabilistic durability prediction using Monte-Carlo methods
