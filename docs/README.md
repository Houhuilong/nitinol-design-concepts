Welcome to NDC
==============

Nitinol Devices and Components was founded in 1991, and has been a leader in design, development, and commercialization of nitinol materials, components, and medical devices. Now as part of Confluent Medical Technologies, our capabilities have expanded to include medical balloons, catheters, polymers, textiles, and world class manufacturing capabilities. Science, publication, outreach, and education have always been a priority for us, as you can see at the Confluent nitinol reference library found at [nitinol.com](https://nitinol.com). This site, Nitinol Design Concepts, is an open-source, creative-commons spin on that tradition, including real-world examples to help engineers get started with design and simulation of nitinol components.

All of the resources found here, including all of the original native design and simulation files, as well as the pages you are now reading, are available [here on GitHub](..).
