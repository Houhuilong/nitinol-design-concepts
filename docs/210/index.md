# Volumetric characterization of inclusions from submicron CT scans

**Objective:** Characterize the density, size, shape, and orientations of inclusions in a sample of nitinol material based on submicron resolution x-ray computed tomography scan results. 

**Prerequisites:** X-ray computed tomography microscope. This study utilized a [ZEISS Xradia 520 Versa instrument at Stanford Nano Shared Facilitiess](https://snsf.stanford.edu/equipment/xsa/xct.html).

## Introduction

[NDC-205 Advancing Nitinol Fatigue Durability Prediction](../205) reviews limitations of our current practice of fatigue lifetime prediction, and proposes some possibilities for advancing our predictive capabilities. Material purity (or conversely impurity) is an important factor in fatigue performance, as fractures virtually always originate at the location of a surface or near-surface impurity. Conventional metallurgical cross-sectioning techniques provide a two-dimensional view of impurities, typically in selected longitudinal and transverse planes. This information is useful, but can not be directly applied to a three dimensional structural analysis without making significant assumptions.

X-ray computed tomography (XCT) methods can provide a three-dimensional view of a sample volume of material. Until recently, sub-micron resolution XCT scans required a high energy beam source, such as a synchrotron, and were therefore inaccessible for routine characterization. We have found that modern commercially available XCT instruments are capable of resolving impurities commonly found in standard nitinol material. This exercise reviews methods used to obtain an XCT scan for a nitinol tubing sample, and derive a "fingerprint" of the inclusions contained within.
