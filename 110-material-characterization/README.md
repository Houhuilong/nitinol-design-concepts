# Mechanical Properties

_This is a placeholder for an upcoming document describing mechanical property testing. The current uses generic material properties, and mechanical performance of the manufactured component does not match that predicted by simulation. Mechanical property testing is planned, and will be documented here, along with updated simulation results, when complete._

For now, continue to [Shape Setting](../115-open-frame-shape-set).
