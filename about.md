About This Project
==================

Nitinol Devices and Components was founded in 1991, and has always been a leader in design, development, and commercialization of nitinol materials, components, and medical devices. Now as part of [Confluent Medical Technologies](https://confluentmedical.com), we have expanded to include medical balloons, catheters, precision polymers, textiles, and world class manufacturing capabilities. Science, publication, outreach, and education have always been a priority for us, and you can find many of our papers at the [nitinol.com](https://nitinol.com) reference library. 

Nitinol Design Concepts is an open-source, creative-commons spin on that tradition. Each topic in this series includes a tech-brief style articles, as indexed on the [front page](/nitinol-design-concepts.). All of the related design files, results, code, and data can be found in the [nitinol-design-concepts](https://github.com/confluentmedical/nitinol-design-concepts) GitHub repository.
